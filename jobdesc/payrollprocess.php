The following must be <b>complete and updated</b> before going to the next step:<br><br>
        <ol><li>All new employees and BPI accounts must have been recorded.</li>
            <li>Branch assignments are updated.</li>
            <li>Salary rates are updated and complete.</li>
            <li>Pay dates table must be edited to put actual payroll date, number of regular workdays, and dates for checking for holiday pay.  Always indicate in the Remarks the holidays for the period.</li>
            <li>Set resigned employees as resigned in the system, so all future attendance are deleted, and payroll will not be sent to the bank.</li>
            <li>Attendance!</li></ol><br><hr><br>

        Data of the Attendance module is SEPARATE from data of the Payroll module.  The Attendance Summary sent from the Attendance module can be seen in Attendance Basis for Payroll.<br><br>
        
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b><i>Important:</i></b>
        &nbsp &nbsp Attendance Summary is <font style="color:maroon; font-weight:600;" >FIXED</font> in the Attendance module, 
        but Attendance Basis is <font style="color:maroon; font-weight:600;" >EDITABLE</font> in the Payroll module.<br><br><br>
        
        <u>Special attendance concerns</u>:  (All details must be recorded in Remarks for the employee's current payroll, to explain the difference from records in the Attendance module.)  <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjustments from previous payroll periods (over- or underpayments of salaries/overtime) - These must be adjusted in terms of attendance rather than directly into payroll amounts because this affects the calculation of the 13th month pay.</li><br>
            <li>New semi-monthly paid employees - Calculation for their <b>first cut-off</b> is similar to daily-paid employees.  Succeeding payrolls will be same as other semi-monthly.</li>
        </ol><br><br><hr><br>
        Check <i>Missing Data for Payroll</i> to ensure that there will be no errors in the next step.<br><br>
        <h3><font style="color:maroon; " >When all data are complete, click on Process Payroll and process the correct Payroll ID. </font></h3><br><hr><br>
        
        Actions done when payroll is processed:<br><br>
        <ol><li>Salaries are calculated based on attendance.</li>
            <li>Deductions for government-mandated benefits and tax are recorded.</li>
            <li>All recorded scheduled adjustments, such as loans and advances, are encoded for the payroll period. </li>
        </ol><br><hr><br>

       <h3><font style="color:maroon; " >Next steps:</font></h3><br>
       <ol><li>Open Payroll Data Per Payroll ID to check if everything is in order. Check that there is no negative Net Pay. Calculations for absences and holiday pay, especially for semi-monthly, must always be verified.</li>
           <li>Add adjustments if necessary, such as deductions for inventory discrepancies.  The menu item Auto Add Invty Charges may be used, but values must be each be checked to ensure that deductions are <i>within reason</i>.</li>
            <li>There must be no negative net pay values.</li>
            <li>Lookup Summary for BPI for final checking of values.  Take special notice account numbers of new employees are accurate.</li>
            <li>When everything is in order, ask the HR Dept Head to approve payroll.</li>
            <li>Once approved, inform Accounting that payroll is ready for upload to BPI.</li>
            <li>After upload, Accounting must process the vouchers for accounting records.</li>
            <li>Accounting must complete the deposit entries to account for all charges deducted from the payroll.  Details from the deposit slip will be seen on the employees' payslips.  These must always be accurate and final before payday.</li>
