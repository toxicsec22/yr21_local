Changing passwords can be done on webmail. Note that you will have to <i>edit the saved password on your email application</i>. If you do not update that, multiple unauthorized attempts to connect to the mail server will be recorded, resulting in our entire office to be blocked from the mail server.

Each email user is responsible for his/her own password. If a password is forgotten, a request for password reset may be sent to Gen Admin Dept.  Unreasonable frequency of reset requests will not be tolerated.
